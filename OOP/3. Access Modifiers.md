Access modifiers allow us to set the level of access a class, method, variable, or constructor can get. There are four access modifiers: **Private, Public, Default, Protected**

---

## Public : 
Accessible for all classes

## Private : 
Only Accessible within the class itself

## Default : 
Only accessible within the same package. Doesn't need to specified

## Protected : 
Only accessible within the same package and subclasses. The subclass can inherit the values from a protected class

---
# Non-Access Modifiers
---

## Abstract : 
Cannot be used to create objects. Abstract method is provided by the abstract class but the body is in the subclass
## Final : 
Cannot be inherited by other classes. Methods cannot be overridden/modified. You wouldn't wanna modify PI right?
## Static : 
attributes belong to class rather than objects. You can modify it without having to call a constructor
