# Static

In Java, when we declare a field _static_, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class.

When you create a static method, you can actually just write down the function call without having to construct an object for it

```java
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }
```


```java
myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
// myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error
```



---
# Public

A public variable means that all this field can be accessed anywhere from the code and therefor can be changed by anybody

When you create a public method, you must create an object to be then able to utilize that function call

```java
public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }
```


```java
    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object
```

---
# Extra

This code will not compile as x in the last SysOut cannot reach x in the Main class

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 10;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 25; // x is now 25
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
    System.out.println(x); // this line is the reason why it won't compile
  }
}
```


However adding static to the int x increases the scope and when this compiles, both x and myObj.x have a value of 25. Which means myObj.x assigning a new value changes the value in int x = 10 to int x = 25

```java
public class Main {
  static int x = 10;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 25; // x is now 25
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```
