# The Three Fins

In Java, we have three keywords that may sound similar but do three different things

## Final

Final is the keyword we use to restrict modification or access to variable, method, or class.


|                | Variable                  | Method                                 | Class                |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Definition** | Making constant variables | Prevents methods from being overriding | Prevents Inheritance |
